# RainyNuScenes: A Data Partition for Benchmarking Contaminated Vehicle Cameras through Rain

This repository contains the official Python implementation for the research paper **"RainyNuScenes: A Data Partition for Benchmarking Contaminated Vehicle Cameras through Rain."** 

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
RainyNuScenes is a novel dataset designed to benchmark the impact of **water droplets on vehicle-mounted cameras** in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (**ADAS**). The dataset is an extension of the widely-used **NuScenes dataset**, featuring **762 annotated images** with over **1,700 labeled water droplets**, enabling precise evaluation of their effects on perception systems.

### ðŸ”¬ Research Focus
This work addresses the challenges posed by **adverse weather conditions**, particularly rain, on camera-based perception systems. We provide:
- A **detailed dataset** for water droplet detection and segmentation.
- A **comparative analysis** with related datasets like **WoodScape**.
- Benchmarking of **CNN-based segmentation models** trained on RainyNuScenes and other datasets.
- Insights into **model generalizability and robustness** for real-world ADAS applications.
